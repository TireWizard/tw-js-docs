# Application Refactor

## Overview

`ApplicationRefactor` serves as the central component within our application, rendering all other components and managing their state changes. As the main orchestrator of the app, it carries out essential tasks, controlling the layout, and ensuring each part of the application communicates effectively with others.




## Header 

An integral part of `ApplicationRefactor` is the `renderHeader()` function, responsible for rendering the header of the webpage. The header section encapsulates elements such as the logo, the search bar, and the navigation bar, all crucial for user navigation and overall user experience.

Here's a glimpse of the `renderHeader()` function, demonstrating how we dynamically render various headers based on the `defaultTemplate`:

```jsx title="renderHeader"
 {this.renderHeader()} // this is initialized render component 
// deep dive into the renderHeader function

switch (defaultTemplate) {
        case "audi":
          return this.renderLogoRight();
        case 'audi_2021':
          return this.renderAudiHeader();
        case 'bmw':
          return this.renderProductSelectionLeftHeader();
        case "hyundai":
          return this.renderNarrowHeader();
        case "mazda":
          return this.renderProductSelectionHeader();
        case "mercedes":
          return this.renderReducedHeader();
        case "mercedes_2022":
          return this.renderReducedHeader();
        case "mini":
          return this.renderHeaderSecondary();
        case "mrlube":
          return this.renderReducedHeaderSecondary();
        case "kia_2021":
        case "volkswagen_2020":
          return this.renderMobileAlwaysHeader();
        default:
         
          return this.renderLogoLeft();
      }

```

From this implementation, we can see that the header's appearance dynamically changes based on the `defaultTemplate` value. This value, stored in the `ApplicationRefactor` component's state, is assigned based on the template passed in the URL.

The different `render` methods `(e.g., renderLogoRight(), renderAudiHeader(), etc.)` correspond to different header styles to cater to the diverse templates' needs, offering a flexible and adaptive interface for users. This architectural decision allows our application to maintain a consistent interface, crucial for branding, while adapting to the unique needs of different templates.
